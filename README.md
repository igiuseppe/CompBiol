# Computational-Biology
Analysis of genomic data to find mutations

## General infos
The softwere, written in Python, takes as input two FASTA files (the Wild strain and the Variant one) and gives as output the sequences with the SNPs

## Libraries
The libraries used are:
* numpy
* biopython
* jellyfish
* matplotlib

## Instructions
To run the project, open the terminal and launch it as:
``` $ python main.py reads_v.fasta reads_w.fasta ``` where:
* **reads_v.fasta** is the variant strain
* **reads_w.fasta** is the wild strain

The fully procedure of the project is well explained in the [Report](https://github.com/igiuseppe/Computational-Biology/blob/main/report.pdf)
